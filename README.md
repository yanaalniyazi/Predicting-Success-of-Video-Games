# Predicting-Success-of-Video-Games
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings

Me and my group created this project for our DS110 (Introduction to Data Science with Python) Final where we predicted the success of video games based on several factors such as global and regional sales, and the video game's genre, platform, publisher, ESRB rating and user score (video games given a score by Metacritic's subscribers) 

You can take a look at the Final Paper to understand our process which we explained step-by-step and the insights we were able to retrieve, as well as our presentation we made!
